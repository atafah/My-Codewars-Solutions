This is the softest possible sound a human ear can hear;</li><li>Since the threshold of human hearing involves an extremely small, long number, we need to utilize a logarithmic operation that will provide us the result in a convenient way.</li></ul><p>Your task is to simply calculate the loudness of a sound wave, given its intensity as a parameter to the <strong>dBScale</strong> function.</p><p><em>Results are automatically rounded to the <strong>nearest integer</strong> by the test cases.</em></p>
